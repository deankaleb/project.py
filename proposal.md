# Fireworks

## Repository
<https://github.com/deankaleb/project.py.git>

## Description
My project will display a screensaver that shows fireworks popping as the user moves their mouse around the screen.
This is relevant to digital arts, because I'm using many technical art tools to create a moving and interactive image.

## Features
- Feature 1
	-  Fireworks will shoot out circular around the origin. I will execute this by using a graphical library like Pygame.
- Feature 2
	-  Fireworks will be randomly colorized. I will execute this using random.choices(color) that I learned
    during lab08. 
- Feature 3 
	- Fireworks will be created upon the users mouse movements. I will execute this by researching the py library
    pyautogui, so that the program can respond to mouse movements. 

## Challenges
- I must research all of the different types of py libraries that can help me with executing my code. 
- I will need to research on how to make the screensaver respond to mouse movement. 
- 

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The outcome is for the user to be able to pop fireworks on their screen by moving their mouse across their device of choice. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Creating the fireworks animation and choosing a default automation of speed without the users mouse movements.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Code the shape of the particles.
  2. Code the particles to shoot out equally from a random origin. 

- Week 2
  1. Code the color of the particles.
  2. Code the particles life and death time.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Code the program to respond to mouse movements.
  2. Code the screensaver's resolution and optimize the program.
